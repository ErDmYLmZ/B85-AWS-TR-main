# Hands-on Ansible-02 : Using Playbook with Tasks

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of basic Ansible skills.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- Learn ansible playbooks.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Install ansible

- Part 2 - Ansible Playbooks

## Part 1 - Install Ansible


- Create 3 Amazon Linux 2 and 1 Ubuntu EC2 instances. Then name the instances as below. For Security Group, allow ssh(22) and http(80) when creating EC2.
1-control-node
2-node1
3-node2
4-node3 (ubuntu)

- Connect to the control node with SSH and run the following commands.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y ansible2
```
### Confirm Installation

- To confirm the successful installation of Ansible. You can run the following command.

```bash
$ ansible --version
```
### Configure Ansible on AWS EC2

- Connect to the control node and for this basic inventory, edit `/etc/ansible/hosts`, and add a few remote systems (manage nodes) to the end of the file. For this example, use the IP addresses of the servers.

```bash
$ sudo su
$ cd /etc/ansible
$ ls
$ nano hosts

We can set private ip, because they are in the same VPC

```
```bash
[webservers]
node1 ansible_host=<node1_ip> ansible_user=ec2-user
node2 ansible_host=<node1_ip> ansible_user=ec2-user

[ubuntuservers]
node3 ansible_host=<node2_ip> ansible_user=ubuntu

[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ec2-user/<pem file>
```

- Edit /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as adding below. 

```bash
$ nano ansible.cfg
[defaults]
interpreter_python=auto_silent

# uncomment this to disable SSH key host checking
host_key_checking = False
```

- Copy your pem file to the /etc/ansible/ directory. First go to your pem file directory on your local computer and run the following command.

```bash
$ scp -i <pem file> <pem file> ec2-user@<public DNS name of the control node>:/home/ec2-user
```

- or you can create a file name <pem file> into the directory /etc/ansible on the control node and copy your pem file into it.

## Part 2 - Ansible Playbooks

- Create a yaml file named `playbook1.yml` and make sure all our hosts are up and running.

```yml
---
- name: Test Connectivity
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Ping test
     ping:
```

- Run the yaml file.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml
```

- Create a text file named "testfile1" and write "Hello Ansible" with using echo. Then create a yaml file name `playbook2.yml` and send the "testfile1" to the hosts. 

```bash
echo "Hello Ansible" > testfile1
nano playbook2.yml
```

```yml
---
- name: Copy for linux
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: Copy your file to the webservers
     copy:
       src: /etc/ansible
       dest: /home/ec2-user/testfile1

- name: Copy for ubuntu
  hosts: ubuntuservers
  tasks:
   - name: Copy your file to the ubuntuservers
     copy:
       src: /etc/ansible
       dest: /home/ubuntu/testfile1

```

alternatively, copy the file to all targets:

```yml
---
- name: Copying testfile1 to all nodes
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: copy file to home directory
     copy: 
       src: /etc/ansible
       dest: ~/testfile1

```


- Run the yaml file.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook2.yml
```

- Connect the nodes with SSH and check if the text files are copied or not. 

- Create a yaml file named `playbook3.yml` as below.

```bash
$ vim playbook3.yml
```
```yml
- name: Copy for linux
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: Copy your file to the webservers
     copy:
       src: /home/ec2-user/testfile1
       dest: /home/ec2-user/testfile1
       mode: u+rw,g-wx,o-rwx # u +rw = Dosya sahibi okuyup yazabilsin; g-wx & o-rwx: Group or Others access to a big directory tree without setting execute permission on normal files

- name: Copy for ubuntu
  hosts: ubuntuservers
  tasks:
   - name: Copy your file to the ubuntuservers
     copy:
       src: /home/ec2-user/testfile1
       dest: /home/ubuntu/testfile1
       mode: u+rw,g-wx,o-rwx

- name: Copy for node1
  hosts: node1
  tasks:
   - name: Copy using inline content
     copy:
       content: '# This file was moved to /etc/ansible/testfile2'
       dest: /home/ec2-user/testfile2

   - name: Create a new text file
     shell: "echo Hello World > /home/ec2-user/testfile3"
```

- Run the yaml file.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook3.yml
```
- Connect the **node1** with SSH and check if the text files are there.

- Install Apache server with `playbook4.yml`. After the installation, check if the Apache server is reachable from the browser.

```bash
# Dokumantasyon dosyalari
$ ansible-doc yum
$ ansible-doc apt


$ nano playbook4.yml
```
```yml
---
- name: Apache installation for webservers
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: install the latest version of Apache
     yum:
       name: httpd
       state: latest

   - name: start Apache
     shell: "service httpd start"

- name: Apache installation for ubuntuservers
  hosts: ubuntuservers
  tasks:
   - name: update
     shell: "apt update -y"
     
   - name: install the latest version of Apache
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: latest
```
- Run the yaml file.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -b playbook4.yml
$ ansible-playbook -b playbook4.yml   # Run the command again and show the changing parts of the output.
# -b is required as update and installation needs root privileges.
```

- Create playbook5.yml and remove the Apache server from the hosts.

```bash
$ vim playbook5.yml
```
```yml
---
- name: Remove Apache from webservers
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: Remove Apache
     yum:
       name: httpd
       state: absent #degisti

- name: Remove Apache from ubuntuservers
  hosts: ubuntuservers
  tasks:
   - name: Remove Apache
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: absent #degisti
   - name: Remove unwanted Apache2 packages from the system
     apt:
       autoremove: yes
       purge: yes
```

- Run the yaml file.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -b playbook5.yml
# -b flag to become root
```


- This time, install Apache and wget together with `playbook6.yml`. After the installation, enter the IP-address of node3(ubuntu) to the browser and show the Apache server. Then, connect node1 with SSH and type `httpd` to make sure that it is installed. 
```bash
vim playbook6.yml
```
```yml
---
- name: play 4
  hosts: ubuntuservers
  tasks:
   - name: installing apache
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: latest

   - name: index.html
     copy:
       content: "<h1>Hello Ansible</h1>"
       dest: /var/www/html/index.html

   - name: restart apache2
     service:
       name: apache2
       state: restarted
       enabled: yes

- name: play 5
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: installing httpd and wget
      yum:
        pkg: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - httpd
        - wget
```

- Run the yaml file.

```bash
ansible-playbook -b playbook6.yml
```

- Remove Apache and wget from the hosts with playbook7.yml.

```bash
vim playbook7.yml
```
```yml
---
- name: play 6
  hosts: ubuntuservers
  tasks:
   - name: Uninstalling Apache
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: absent
       update_cache: yes
   - name: Remove unwanted Apache2 packages
     apt:
       autoremove: yes
       purge: yes

- name: play 7
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
   - name: removing apache and wget
     yum:
       pkg: "{{ item }}"
       state: absent
     loop:
       - httpd
       - wget
```

- Run the yaml file.

```bash
ansible-playbook -b playbook7.yml
```
- Recheck the public IP of `node3(ubuntu)` and httpd of node1 or node2 to make sure that services that are installed by `playbook6.yml` is removed. 

- Using ansible loop and conditional, create users with playbook8.yml. 

```bash
vi playbook8.yml
```

```yml
---
- name: Create users
  hosts: "*"
  tasks:
    - user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - Randall
        - matt
        - Jessica
        - oliver
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - david
        - Durren
      when: ansible_os_family == "SUSE"

    - user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - john
        - Robert
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian" or ansible_distribution_version == "20.04"
```

- Run the playbook8.yml

```bash
ansible-playbook -b playbook8.yml
```
- check if the users are assigned

```bash
ssh ec2-user@172.31.95.236 -i key.pem "cat /etc/passwd"
ssh ubuntu@172.31.95.236 -i key.pem "cat /etc/passwd"
```
